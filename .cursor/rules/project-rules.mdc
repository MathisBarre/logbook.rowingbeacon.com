If needed, you can find the "cn" function in the src/_common/utils/utils.ts file.

Don't import date library. Create pure function in src/_common/utils/date.ts.

The icon library is lucide-react, don't install another one.

The componenets reused accross the app can be found in the src/_common/components folder

Don't install shadcn components with cli. Copy paste.
